      Dakota barely squeezes through the tiny opening. The natural light illuminates the cavern just barely, through tiny holes in the cavern ceiling above. Dakota pulls out his flashlight, but it barely flickers on, certainly ruined from the water. He squints, seeing something in the large opening inside the canyon abyss. Finally, his eyes adjust to the dark, and he lets out an audible gasp. The opening inside the canyon is nearly a mile long. Much larger than he realized. The Piranha Run trickles into the opening, creating a peacful stream from one end to the other. And there, resting undisturbed for nearly 1,000 years is the Lost City of Gold. Perfectly preserved, the peaceful city rests. It’s small buildings, carved from solid gold, adorned with ornate decorations and statues. A gate to the city blocks the end closest him, with the Piranha Run trickling underneath it. Completely hidden from the jungle and the mountains, the city hasn’t been seen for almost a millenium. Congratulations!
