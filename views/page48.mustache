      Nice job!  Dakota made it to the Ragged Snag Village.  You're just a few miles from the Jungle.  In town, you can go anywhere you'd like.  Maybe you can ask for directions, or get some needed supplies.  However, there's a catch.  In the jungle, you navigate with if/else statements.  But in town you can only navigate with JSON Objects.  JSON Objects are JavaScript Objects that have key, value pairs.  Take this for example:

        <div>apple {</div>
          <div>color: green,</div>
          <div>taste: sweet,</div>
          <div>texture: crispy,</div>
        <div>}</div>

          In this example, the apple's keys are green, taste & texture.  And it's associated values are green, sweet & crispy.  If we stored several apples as objects in JavaScript, it would be easy to categorize, and find just the ones we wanted.  In town, you can control what Dakota does, by choosing between givin JSON objects. For example, if you think Dakota needs some rest, you might look for a JSON object that looks like this:

          <div>The B&B {</div>
            <div>cost: $20,</div>
            <div>vacancy: true,</div>
            <div>comfort: average,</div>
          <div>}</div>

          Good luck!
